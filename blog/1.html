      <h2>This Month I Learned Jekyll</h2>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p class="subheader">September 2015</p>
        <p>
          This month began with a friend's birthday. As a present, I gave her a
          year's worth of domain ($13.17 at Hover.com
          [<a href="https://hover.com/WA2u4UTk">referral link</a>]). But then I
          realized that I wanted to write her the card <span class="b u">on a
          website parked at that domain</span>!
          </p>
        <p>
          To be fiscally efficient, since the physical card I bought for her cost
          more than the domain, I searched for a free, yet premium hosting option.
          Free meant I did not need to pay money. Premium, in this context, meant
          permanently (no trials) void of ads or watermarks.
          </p>
        <p>
          To this end, I tried <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>
          and found it to be just what I needed. In fact, this is how I'm hosting
          this page right now! The github repo that directly pipes to this website
          can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/jeffhou/jeffhou.github.io">https://github.com/jeffhou/jeffhou.github.io</a>.
          Please feel free to comment on this or even submit pull requests ;).
          </p>

          Fascinated by the technology that seemed so simple, yet so foreign, I
          found my way to <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">https://18f.gsa.gov/</a>,
          the government organization that open sources the solutions they build.
          GitHub Repo: <a href="https://github.com/18F">https://github.com/18F</a>.
          There, I tried to tackle one of their easier open bugs/issues. Even
          though I did not end up solving the problem, I did make a comment! It
          was the first time I moved out of my comfort zone in terms of
          participating in an open source repo outside of class.
          </p>
        <p>
          Working on the bug helped me understand more about Jekyll since I had
          to deploy my own Jekyll instance to test solutions to the bug. Here I
          used <a href="https://c9.io/">https://c9.io/</a> as my workspace. It's
          free and is an awesome online platform to develop webapps, but it just
          got acquired by Amazon and it asks for a credit card even for its free
          account. I won't delve into too much detail here, but here's the Hacker
          News discussion: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12092983">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12092983</a>.
          </p>
        <p>
          Now, I'm building and deploying my entire personal website using GitHub
          Pages, Jekyll and Cloud9! I'm really looking forward to working on this
          website more as I learn more and clean up past projects to share with
          the world. Please let me know if you have any questions! Just create an
          <a href="https://github.com/jeffhou/jeffhou.github.io/issues">issue</a>
          on GitHub and let's chat. :)
