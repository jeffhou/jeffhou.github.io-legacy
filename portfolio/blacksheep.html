            This game I made back in college as part of a class where we each created
            our own games in java. This game is pretty simple and mimicks gameplay
            from games like Pokemon, the crux of which is two main layers of gameplay,
            which in this case, includes a main navigation layer and a battle layer.

              On launch, Black Sheep RPG presents an instructions page. The goal of
              the game is to gain stats in the three colors (RGB) by defeating
              enemies.

              Start Game: [Space]

            <p>
              By defeating enemies of a specific color, the player gains stats
              matching the color. As stats change, the color of the player icon
              changes with it -- RGB(red, green, blue).

              In the game, the player (circle) moves around the map fighting 
              enemies (squares). Each move has a chance of generating a new enemy
              (random colored square) in a random open square.

              Movement: [Arrow Keys] <br />

            <p>
              Upon encountering an enemy, battle begins. The strength of the enemy
              is directly proportional to the number of the enemies on the map. 
              The more the player walks, the stronger the enemies get!
              <br /><br />
              Each attack scales with a corresponding stat or in the case of the
              prismatic attack, a sum of all stats.
