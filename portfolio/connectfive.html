          Since early childhood, I have been playing a game akin to the Tic Tac
          Toe. It's called 五子棋 (Wuziqi) in Chinese, 五目並べ (Gomoku) in
          Japanese and Connect Five in English. It's a simple game that can be
          played on a go board or with a pencil and a piece of paper.
          Alternatively, players can play only verbally for a challenge in mental
          finesse.

            The goal of the game is to connect five of your own pieces in a row
            horizontally, vertically or diagnonally.

            The gameplay is cursor-based. Use arrow keys to move the cursor and
            the "z" key to place down a piece at the cursor location. Pieces
            must be placed in empty spaces and turns change between the two players
            after each piece is placed.
